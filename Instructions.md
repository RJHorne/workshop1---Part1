# Workshop 1 - Basic Input and Outut

This first stage of the workshop is to ensure you are able to get the VSCode environment up and working. 

Use the templated code provided to mimic or build upon the basic code we discussed in the lecture. You should be able to enter in a string or a number and get it back out again. You should use scanf to capture the user input, and printf to print out the user input. Make sure you use the correct notation when referring to strings and floats etc. 

If you have any issues, speak to a demonstrator or myself.
